				<h3>Hobbies</h3>
					
					<p> My hobbies include running, eating, traveling and improving my <em>shengdiao</em> when I speak Mandarin.</p>

					<p>I also enjoy long walks on the beach, playing with my two dogs Cooper and Scout and drinking beer while playing ice hockey.</p>

						<h2>Basic info</h2>
						<p>I enjoy graphic design as well as traveling, and think that food is the most important aspect to consider when choosing a place to live. 
						<br/>
						<br/>
						Additionally, I am one of the few Arsenal FC supporters who is sad that Arsene Wenger is leaving the club. However, I hope the club can find a good new manager to come in and replace him.</p>
